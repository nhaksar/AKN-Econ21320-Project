## Todo list
- LASSO regression to identify useful lags
- write up literature review / results
- clean up suicide data
- regressions to run: everything w/ 1 set of FEs at a time; 
                      everything w/ income as a control
                      alcohol separately from drugs
                      with total layoffs next year as placebo (concern about 
                        anticipation)
